[Kate](https://bbconsulting.be/architecture/2022/01/03/digital.html),the AI-Driven Personal Digital Assistant of [KBC](https://www.kbc.be/), saw daylight in December 2020. 
KBC always intended for Kate to "grow up in public".
This meant, we had to do a lot of (small) releases.
We did a production release at least once a week.
To do this at scale (Kate is live in five banks of the KBC Group: Belgium (KBC and CBC), Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria), industrialization was very important.
Development and deployment needed to be swift and easy.
When we started Kate, I was the first (and only) technical person on the team.
But over the course of two years, multiple subteams were created and the [Kate train](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/) was over 130 people strong. 
We created our own software factory.
A software factory reduces workload by providing a standard, integrated, validated toolchain for the CI/CD pipeline and a set of engineering services to support them.

Being part of this evolution was a wonderful experience, that taught me a lot.
With the software factory in place, I started looking for new challenges.

So when KBC approached me to design and create its Programmable Money Platform, I didn't hesitate.
KBC wanted to create a [programmable e-money token](https://newsroom.kbc.com/kbc-zorgt-met-de-kate-coin-een-eigen-op-blockchain-gebaseerde-digitale-munt-voor-een-primeur-in-europa), called Kate Coin, based on blockchain technology.
A completely new economy, based on technology like web 3.0 and cryptocurrency, is developing and KBC wants to remain the reference in digital banking.
Kate Coin is a stable coin, used in a closed-loop environment.
This means it only holds value in that environment.

Last Sunday, we did a large-scale test at [Werchter Boutique](https://www.werchterboutique.be/en/).
Over 8000 KBC employees could purchase Kate Coins and spend them on food and drinks.
All of this from within KBC Mobile, voted the ["best mobile banking app in the world"](https://newsroom.kbc.com/kbc-mobile-door-onafhankelijk-internationaal-onderzoeksbureau-sia-partners-uitgeroepen-tot-beste-mobile-banking-app-wereldwijd)
This has never been done in Europe.
It is pretty unique for a software engineer to be backstage at an event of this scale and I consider myself very lucky to have been a part of it.  

KateCoin was build on top of [Hyperledger Fabric, a Blockchain Platform for the Enterprise](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
It uses smart contracts, that run when predetermined conditions (an agreement between buyer and seller) are met, written in Java code.
From a technical point-of-view, Werchter Boutique was (only) a test: agreements with partners have already been made to grow this ecosystem, meaning external companies will run their own [peer nodes](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peers/peers.html).
We are currently working on making Kate Coin available in KBC Mobile for its 1.8 million users.
