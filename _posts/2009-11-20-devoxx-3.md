Last day of Devoxx today, actually it was only half a day as the conference ended at 13h. Devoxx was a nice experience for me: interesting presentations from famous and less-famous speakers, a relaxed atmosphere and an opportunity to encounter old class mates or former colleagues. I heard many people say that the previous editions featured more exhibitions, but that's likely caused by our economical climate. After an event like Devoxx, there is quite a lot of new (to me) technology I want to try out, such as Scala, JavaFX, Android, ...

First session I attended today, was on the Pomodoro Technique. The goal of this technique is to focus on 1 thing for a fixed amount of time, referred to as a time box (25mins). The Pomodoro Technique is an adaptive process that consists of 5 stages: plan, track, record, process and visualize. During a time box (= a pomodoro) you should only focus on the planned task. After this time box, a small amount of time is assigned to take a break.  Of course external and internal interruptions are likely to occur. If possible, you should invert the dependency of these interruptions.
In my opinion the session was quite interesting, but I don't see how I could personally practise it ... nevertheless the inversion of dependencies is something I'm going to give a try.

</a>Modular Web Applications with OSGI, showed us a Spring implementation to horizontally and vertically divide an application in to modules, using <a title="Slices" href="http://blog.springsource.com/2009/06/22/modular-web-applications-with-springsource-slices/" target="_blank">SpringSource Slices</a>. This presentation was also interesting, but didn't bring much <strong>new</strong> ideas. I expected to learn more about web applications with OSGI ...

<a title="Lombok" href="http://projectlombok.org/" target="_blank">Project Lombok</a> is a project that offers solutions to reduce or even eliminate boilerplate code: getters/setters/finally blocks/toString/equals/hashcode/unchecked exceptions/.. Using simple annotations (@Data, @Getter, ...), it is possible to write Pojo's, without accessor methods. I believe this project certainly has a future, however at the moment it felt unfinished: only integration with Javac and Eclipse, not possible to refactor once generated, ...  It would have been nice if some of it's features were part of the Java language as is the case in C#.

So far, my 3 days at Devoxx. I hope to be there next year!
