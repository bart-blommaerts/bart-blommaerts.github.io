Last Friday I organised an Android Workshop at <a title="HP" href="http://www.hp.be" target="_blank">HP</a>. The target audience were Java developers. I divided the workshop in 7 steps and explained the basic concepts of Android application development through code samples. The code is available on <a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Creation of a new project, with a Master/Detail Flow, introducing Fragments, Activities, Views, .. with different layout for tablets and smartphones. Demonstration of the Android application life cycle.

</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Step 2: Introduction of SQLite database with service class to enable CRUD operations.

    <li>Step 3: Added a new Activity to enable inserting new items in the SQLite database.

The end result is not an actual (or useful) application, but demonstrates some of the core principles of Android development.
