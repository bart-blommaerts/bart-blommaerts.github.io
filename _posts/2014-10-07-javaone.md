Last week I had to opportunity to attend <a title="JavaOne" href="http://www.javaone.com" target="_blank">JavaOne</a> in San Francisco, as a speaker. JavaOne is the largest Java conference in the world and takes place at the same time as <a title="Oracle Open World" href="https://www.oracle.com/openworld" target="_blank">Oracle OpenWorld</a>. In a way JavaOne is a conference, within a conference. JavaOne also had a very large (and crowdy) exhibition hall, featuring the usual suspects (<a title="Red Hat" href="http://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank">Red Hat</a>, <a title="Atlassian" href="http://www.atlassian.com" target="_blank">Atlassian</a>, <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, ...) but also a number of exhibitors that I didn't know before. For me it was the first time to attend JavaOne, but I've been to <a title="Devoxx" href="http://www.devoxx.be/" target="_blank">Devoxx</a> for the past 5 years. While Devoxx and JavaOne share a lot of similarities, the specific focus of the 2 conferences feels quite different:
<ul>
	<li>Devoxx has a wide(r) focus on technology and open-source. For example: Devoxx always has a lot of Google talks (Chrome Dev Tools, Android, Angular, ..). Devoxx <em>(generally)</em> features the latest and greatest technology that is worth looking at today. Actual adoption in an enterprise environment might require some time.</li>
	<li>The main focus of JavaOne really is Java SE and Java EE and how these can support a business today.</li>
</ul>
From a developer's point of view, both have their merits and they complement one another. Unfortunately I won't be able to make Devoxx this year ...

<h2>Key takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>JEE: there was an obvious focus on Java SE 8 and <a title="Java EE 7" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/" target="_blank">EE 7</a>, but also some first looks at Java EE 8. In the next few days / weeks, I'm looking forward to learn more about <a title="WildFly 8.x" href="http://wildfly.org/downloads/" target="_blank">WildFly 8.x</a>.</li>
	<li><a title="Project Valhalla" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/" target="_blank">Project Valhalla:</a> Planned for Java 9 (or later ..) Project Valhalla is looking at the implementation of <a title="Value Types" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169" target="_blank">Value Types</a> (reference-free objects), <a title="Generics" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8046267" target="_blank">Generics Specialization</a> (primitive type support for generics), ... in the language and the JVM, with better performance as a goal. <a title="Brian Goetz" href="https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz" target="_blank">Brian Goetz</a> showed some "early code" at the keynote that looked very interesting.</li>
	<li><a title="Project Panama" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/" target="_blank">Project Panama:</a> Also planned for Java 9 (or later ..) Project Panama seeks to introduce a <a title="Foreign Function Interface" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/191" target="_blank">Foreign Function Interface</a> that can bind to native functions. Another exciting feature will be <a title="Arrays 2.0" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jvmls2014goetzrose-2265201.pdf" target="_blank">"Arrays 2.0"</a>.</li>
	<li><a title="Project Jigsaw" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/" target="_blank">Project Jigsaw:</a> Project Jigsaw is better know as the "Modular JDK" project and aims to design and implement a standand module system for the Java SE platform. I think many people have been waiting for this (for quite some time). I'm definitely looking forward to this one.</li>
	<li><a title="JCache" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107" target="_blank">JCache</a> is final and an <a title="Ehcache" href="https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache-jcache" target="_blank">Ehcache</a> implementation is also available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My talk:</h2>
My talk <a title="Efficiently building and deploying microservices" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3631" target="_blank">"Efficiently building and deploying microservices"</a> was hosted at the Hilton Hotel on Thursday. I was excited to have a full room (about 150 people. Almost all of them pre-registered.) and even more excited to get so much (positive) feedback afterwards. After the talk, I had conversations in the hallway for over an hour with different attendees. I particularly remember someone's input regarding performance: I'm including that in the next talk on this topic! Of course it's always nice to get feedback from the <a title="Spring" href="http://spring.io/" target="_blank">Spring</a> team since I included a <a title="Spring Boot" href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a> demo. They recommended me to have a look at <a title="Spring Cloud" href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/" target="_blank">Spring Cloud</a> as it features some tooling that fit microservices well, for example <a title="Spring Cloud Netflix" href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/" target="_blank">Spring Boot Netflix</a> that supports Service Discovery (<a title="Eureka" href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka" target="_blank">Eureka</a>), Circuit-Breaker (<a title="Hystrix" href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix" target="_blank">Hystrix</a>) and Intelligent Routing (<a title="Zuul" href="https://github.com/Netflix/zuul" target="_blank">Zuul</a>).

It did struck me few people seem to know that HP (Enterprise Services) also does software development. I think we need to promote that as we have quite a large and skilled developer base.
