Last Friday, I started reading <a title="Hello, Android" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356492/ref=s9_simi_gw_p14_t1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=122BBVJTQC5MN917WSVV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846" target="_blank">Hello, Android - Introducing Google’s Mobile Development Platform, 2nd Edition</a> by Ed Burnette, which I wholeheartedly recommend as an introduction to <a title="Android" href="http://www.android.com/" target="_blank">Android</a>. In the first few chapters, you'll learn the basics of any Android application: user interface, menus, settings, dialog boxes, (2D) graphics, sound, persistency, debugging, ... while building a fully functional Sudoku application.

Later in the book a lot of the core aspects of android are introduced, all in easy to follow examples: video, the SQLite-database, Internet connectvity, Widgets  and a lot more. The book also features a chapter about OpenGL, but I have to say I skipped that. Chances are slim I will ever need that ...

Personally I would have liked to read more on using the different Layouts for designing (more complex) user interfaces. Maybe that's something for an "advanced" book or for a next version of this one.

If you're eager to start with Android, get this book, I finished it in less then 2 evenings ...
