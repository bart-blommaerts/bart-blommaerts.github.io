<a title="FOSDEM" href="https://fosdem.org/2013/" target="_blank">FOSDEM</a> (the Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting) is an, <a title="HP" href="http://www.hp.com/" target="_blank">HP</a> sponsored, event that offers open source communities a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Participation and attendance is <strong>free</strong>. For those interested in Open Source and Linux at HP, <a title="Open Source and Linux at HP" href="http://hp.com/go/opensource/" target="_blank">this link</a> contains supported projects and events. FOSDEM takes place in Brussels, Belgium and uses the <a title="ULB" href="http://www.ulb.ac.be/" target="_blank">ULB</a> infrastructure. ULB is a university in Belgium. For me, it was the first time I attended FOSDEM.
<h1>The state of OpenJDK</h1>
After the keynote, I headed to the <a title="Free Java Devroom" href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/free_java/" target="_blank">Free Java Devroom</a>, where <a title="Mark Reinhold" href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/speaker/mark_reinhold/" target="_blank">Mark Reinhold</a> was speaking about the state of <a title="OpenJDK" href="http://openjdk.java.net/" target="_blank">OpenJDK</a>. I was looking forward to this talk, as I am currently using OpenJDK on a development build server and I was eager to learn more about it. The talk started with an overview of new projects that were being developed on OpenJDK, such as <a title="JDK8 Spec" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/spec/" target="_blank">JSR337</a>: the <a title="JCP" href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=337" target="_blank">JDK8 spec</a>. It was also nice to hear that approx. 98% of the code of the OpenJDK is identical to the Oracle JDK, with the exception of web profiles and web start as those are private to the Oracle JDK.

After recent security issues with Java, Mark stated that more (and more) attention is spent in the security area in both the Oracle JDK and OpenJDK. This was illustrated by the JDK7 update 13 that was released yesterday. Since this is a security update (CPU = Critical Patch Update), we will never see JDK7 update 12. I didn't know about this (strange) <a title="Versioning" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/java-update-release-numbers-change-1836624.html" target="_blank">versioning system</a> at Oracle. JDK7 update 13 was scheduled for mid February, but was released early to address security flaws with 50 fixes.

Mark also mentioned the <a title="JEPs" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1" target="_blank">JEPs</a>: JDK Enhancement Proposals. JEPs are proposals to serve as the long-term Roadmap for JDK Release Projects. Of special mention was <a title="JEP 161" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161" target="_blank">JEP 161</a>: Compact Profiles. In this JEP subset Profiles of the Java SE Platform Specification are defined, so that applications that do not require the entire Platform can be deployed and run on small(-er) devices. It will be interesting to see how this transitions into Project Jigsaw, if it does.
<h1>OpenJDK7u, progress and highlights</h1>
Next up was OpenJDK7u, progress and hightlights by <a title="Sean Coffey" href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/speaker/sean_coffey/" target="_blank">Sean Coffey</a>. Sean explained the difficulties and challenges to release updates for the OpenJDK and said they were working on process improvement (eg. communication and bug tracking: Oracle uses <a title="Jira" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview" target="_blank">Jira</a> internally and will also change their public bug tracker to Jira). Sean mentioned that everybody can get involved with OpenJDK, through this <a title="OpenJDK Contribute" href="http://openjdk.java.net/contribute/" target="_blank">contribution page</a>.
<h1>Firefox OS</h1>
During lunch break, I had the opportunity to play with <a title="Firefox OS" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a> on an LG smartphone. I will gladly repeat .. I'm a big fan of <a title="Android" href="http://www.android.com/" target="_blank">Android</a> and had rather low expectations of Firefox OS... In my humble opinion, Firefox OS <em>really</em> doesn't look good .. but what is worse: it didn't feel responsive or snappy. I know it's still very early: not even developer builds are available. Those were promised for February. I think a lot of work still has to be done .. and that is without mentioning different crashes I saw. Choice is always good, but as of now I'm not feeling Firefox OS (or <a title="Ubuntu for phones" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone" target="_blank">Ubuntu for phones</a> for that matter).
<h1>Learning to Automate</h1>
<a title="Learning to Automate" href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/learning_to_automate/" target="_blank">Learning to Automate</a> by <a title="Nathen Harvey" href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/speaker/nathen_harvey/" target="_blank">Nathen Harvey</a> was about automating different jobs of system administrators. Automation to:
<ul>
  <li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Deliver value to customers</span></li>
  <li>Make IT professionals happy (= less boring, repetitive work)</li>
  <li>Make hardware fully disposable</li>
</ul>
Tools to allow automation are <a title="Chef" href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/" target="_blank">Opscode Chef</a>, <a title="Puppet Labs" href="https://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">Puppet Labs</a> and <a title="CFEngine" href="http://cfengine.com/" target="_blank">CFEngine</a>. These tools often come with predefined configuration scenarios, eg. <a title="Chef Cookbooks" href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbooks" target="_blank">Chef Cookbooks</a>. This seems like a very interesting approach to sharing knowledge (to me). Another tool mentioned was <a title="Vagrant" href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> to put together a development environment through configuration.
