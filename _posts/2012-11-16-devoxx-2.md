The second part of <a title="Devoxx" href="http://www.devoxx.com/" target="_blank">Devoxx</a> consists of 3 Conference Days. The talks during the Conference Days are shorter then those of the University Days. Also during the Conference Days "Quickies" are organised in between sessions; Quickies are even shorter talks (15 mins) on a very specific subject.
<h1>Day 1: Methodology and Lambda expressions</h1>
After the keynote, I opted for: <a title="7 things how to make good teams great" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/7+Things++How+to+make+good+teams+great" target="_blank">7 Things: How to make good teams great</a> by <a title="Sven Peters" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Sven+Peters" target="_blank">Sven Peters</a> of <a title="Atlassian" href="http://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a>. This turned out to be a great talk. I have a short list containing his 7 suggestions:
<ol>
	<li>It's flowtime: discussed the problem with productivity when interrupted ..</li>
	<li>Feed your brain: visit conferences, take part in coding sessions, organize brown bags, ... I would like to add: become an active participant of a JUG.</li>
	<li>Say: well done: on the importance of (public) appreciation.</li>
	<li>Report robot: measure everything and make sure reports are generated automatically.</li>
	<li>Eat your own dog food: Use the software you have built, before shipping it to the customer.</li>
	<li>Do a special day: 1 day to do less pleasant things, such as documentation.</li>
	<li>Experimentation days: At <a title="Atlassian" href="http://www.atlassian.com/shipit-day" target="_blank">Atlassian</a> they experiment during ShipIt Day, 20% time and innovation week.</li>
</ol>
<div>Sven also shared disclaimers regarding the feasibility of these suggestions. I strongly believe these (in 1 way or another) contribute to developer motivation!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Another very interesting talk was <a title="On the road to JDK 8" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/On+the+road+to+JDK+8++Lambda%2C+parallel+libraries%2C+and+more" target="_blank">On the road to JDK8: LAMBDA, PARALLEL LIBRARIES, AND MORE</a> by <a title="Joe Darcy" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Joe+Darcy" target="_blank">Joe Darcy</a>. Joe started his talk by explaining the difficulty to implement these kind of large languages changes (without actually breaking the language) and then went on to explain and illustrate Lambda expressions (closures), interface evolution (default methods) and parallelism. It struck me how (relatively) simple, Oracle kept the syntax. I intended to give some code examples, but I found <a title="nice article" href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/collections-overview.html" target="_blank">this nice article</a> by <a title="Brian Goetz" href="http://www.briangoetz.com/" target="_blank">Brian Goetz</a> that has a lot of code examples and a good explanation. I'm especially a fan of the internal iteration, combined with the stream operation style:</div>
<div><pre>
int sum = blocks.filter(b -&gt; b.getColor() == BLUE)
                .map(b -&gt; b.getWeight())
                .sum();
</pre>

</div>
<div>

It always should have been like that :-) I also think the default implementation of an interface is a good thing. Sure this is multiple inheritance of behavior, but not of state.
<div></div>
Other fun and interesting talks were the talk about <a title="Raspberry PI" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Do+you+like+coffee+with+your+dessert+++Java+and+the+Raspberry+Pi" target="_blank">Java on the Raspberry Pi</a> and the possibilities of the <a title="Chrome Dev Tools" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/The+Chrome+Dev+Tools+can+do+THAT" target="_blank">Chrome Dev Tools</a>.

<h1>Day 2: Testing and anti-patterns</h1>
Day 2 started with a Google Keynote, where they illustrated their current "hot" technologies: Maps, Android, Authentication and Chrome. Google presented some impressive demos (eg. live webcam editing in HTML5) and illustrated they really are on top of the game. After the keynote, I opted for the talk on <a title="Unitils" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Unitils+++Full+stack+testing+solution+for+enterpise+applications" target="_blank">Unitils For Enterprise Applications</a> by <a title="Smals" href="https://www.smals.be/" target="_blank">Smalls</a>. I had used <a title="Unitils" href="http://www.unitils.org/" target="_blank">Unitils</a> before in different projects, so I didn't really learn a lot of new things. I did like their explanation of the module system (eg. WebDriver module, Database module, Mail module, ..) and they also provided some explanation on the difference between unit, integration and system tests.

After Unitils, I attended a brilliant talk on <a title="Anti-Patterns" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Modern+Software+Development+Anti-Patterns" target="_blank">Modern Software Development Anti-Patterns</a> by <a title="Martijn Verbrug" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Martijn+Verburg" target="_blank">Martijn Verbrug</a> ('the Diabolical Developer') and <a title="Ben Evans" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Ben+Evans" target="_blank">Ben Evans</a>. In the ironical style so typical for Martijn, they actually had a very good point to make: think carefully about the choices you make regarding:
<ul>
	<li>technology: don't follow all the hypes.</li>
	<li>methodology: find one that works for your specific use case.</li>
	<li>architecture: design what you need, but don't "over-design".</li>
</ul>
Martijn did a somewhat similar talk last year at Devoxx that is also worth checking out on <a title="Parleys" href="http://www.parleys.com/" target="_blank">Parleys</a>.

Other talks I attended were: <a title="JSR 353" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/JSR+353+++Java+API+for+JSON+Processing" target="_blank">JSR353: Java API for JSON</a> and <a title="ADT" href="http://www.devoxx.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6391173" target="_blank">Android Developers' Tools</a>. I was impressed with the evolution of the <a title="ADT" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/index.html" target="_blank">ADT</a>. It has been a couple of years since I last did <a title="Android Development" href="http://developer.android.com/index.html" target="_blank">Android Development</a>, but the talk made me want to get started again.

Special mention goes out to the <a title="Parleys" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Progressing+Parleys.com%2C+a+Java+based+e-Learning+platform" target="_blank">Parleys</a> talk by <a title="Jo Voordeckers" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Jo+Voordeckers" target="_blank">Jo Voordeckers</a>, <a title="Stephan Janssen" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Stephan+Janssen" target="_blank">Stephan Janssen</a> and <a title="Benjamin Dobler" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Benjamin+Dobler" target="_blank">Benjamin Dobler</a>. They decided to completely re-write their application, using HTML5. This kind of use-case was very interesting for me to get a "feel" on the current state of HTML5. While their accomplishments are impressive, it struck me how many different JavaScript libraries they needed to get it all working: <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a title="Require.JS" href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">Require.JS</a>, <a title="Backbone.JS" href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.JS</a>, <a href="http://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment.JS</a>, <a title="Phantom.JS" href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank">Phantom.JS</a>, <a title="Underscore.JS" href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">Underscore.JS</a> and <a title="Handlebars.JS" href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars</a>. They managed to do it in 3 months though, with only 3 people.
<h1>Day 3: Java FX and Java EE</h1>
Day 3 started with <a title="Annotation Features" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Annotation+Features+in+JDK+8" target="_blank">Annotation Features in JDK8</a> by <a title="Joel Borggren-franck" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Joel+Borggren-franck" target="_blank">Joel Borggren-franck</a>. The biggest addition was JSR308: Type Annotations. The examples were concise and clear. After this talk on language changes, I moved on the <a title="Java FX" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Building+Amazing+Applications+with+JavaFX" target="_blank">Building Amazing Applications with Java FX</a> by <a title="Richard Bair" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Richard+Bair" target="_blank">Richard Bair</a> and <a title="Jasper Potts" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Jasper+Potts" target="_blank">Jasper Potts</a>. Using a scheduling application (for Java One and Devoxx) as an example they explained features of the available Java FX tools. The Scene Builder definitely was impressive. For the first time I had the impression Java FX was really worth looking into. Previous demos were less impressive, but the current tooling and possibilities have evolved nicely. Also fun to see, their demo application was running fine on a Raspberry Pi.

Last talk of the day was <a title="Real World Java EE" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Real+World+Java+EE" target="_blank">Real World Java EE</a> by <a title="Adam Bien" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Adam+Bien" target="_blank">Adam Bien</a>. Most of the talk was Adam live coding a "Slides" application, using different Java EE6 features. I was very impressed by the ease of development of JEE6. Adam combined the coding with tips on which design patterns are useful in a JEE6 context and which should (probably) be avoided. He also advised a 'sane approach' regarding modularity. This combination of JEE6 use and a pragmatic approach regarding design patterns <strong>really</strong> appealed to me. Thus, after the session, I wanted to buy <a title="Real World Patterns" href="http://realworldpatterns.com/" target="_blank">his book: Real World Java EE patterns</a> from the Devoxx bookstore, but unfortunately they weren't selling it yet (it was released 8 weeks ago) so I will have to order it from <a title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Java-Patterns-Rethinking-Practices/dp/1300149310/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. Adam has <a title="Adam Bien" href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/" target="_blank">a blog</a> that is also worth checking.
