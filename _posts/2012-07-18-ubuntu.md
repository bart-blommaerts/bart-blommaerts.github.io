I recently acquired my HP EliteBook 8560w. I decided to install <a title="Ubuntu 12.04 LTS" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</a> on it. Installation was not straightforward, but still quite easy. I wrote down my installation steps, maybe it's useful for someone one day. In my particular case, I wanted a dual boot with Windows 7. The first 2 steps can be disregarded if you're only installing Ubuntu.
<ul>
	<li>Install Windows 7</li>
	<li>Make a new partition for Ubuntu. I went with a 100GB NTFS partition for Windows and left all the rest unallocated. For partitioning I used <a title="EaseUS" href="http://www.easeus.com/" target="_blank">EaseUS</a>. It was the first application I came across and it was free.</li>
	<li>Download Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and install it on a USB stick/CD Rom using the <a title="Pendrive Linux" href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com" target="_blank">Universal USB Installer</a>.</li>
	<li>Boot from the USB stick.</li>
	<li>Select "Run from USB stick" <em>(or something similar)</em> in the menu and press "TAB". At the freshly opened command line add: nouveau.modeset=0 and start Ubuntu.</li>
	<li>After Ubuntu has started select "Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS".</li>
	<li>Choose "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7".</li>
	<li>Reboot from hard drive. Grub will greet you.</li>
</ul>
After that go to "System Settings" &gt; "Additional Drivers" and select the most recent Nvidia drivers. The Nvidia driver version I currently have is 295.49.

That did it for me. Since the HP EliteBook 8560w comes in different hardware configurations, I'll add mine:
<ul>
	<li>Intel® Core™ i7-2820QM CPU @ 2.30GHz × 8</li>
	<li>7.8 GiB memory</li>
	<li>Nvidia Quadro 2000M with 2GB of memory</li>
</ul>
