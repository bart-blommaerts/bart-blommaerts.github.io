Recently, I read <a title="Linchpin" href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162" target="_blank">Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</a> by <a title="Seth Godin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>. While I certainly don't agree with everything in the book, I tought it was a very interesting read. After reading the book, I took some time to make a couple of notes to reflect on what I've read (which I tend to do). Since a large part of the book is about "giving", I will write them down here. Maybe they're useful to someone .. maybe the'yre not.
