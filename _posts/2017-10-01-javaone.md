The last time I visited [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html) was 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tech/2014/10/07/javaone.html">back in 2014</a>. 
So, I was very excited to go back to San Francisco this year.

# Takeaways

## JDK9

JDK9 was the "big topic" of JavaOne, with [Jigsaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5yX-elG4w0) getting a lot of attention.
Jigsaw might break some code (eg. code that uses internal Sun APIs), but Java modularity will surely help further adoption of Java.
Many libraries and frameworks already work together nicely with JDK9.
We saw this in a nice demo of [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) where the IDE does a lot of the Jigsaw heavy lifting.
Another interesting change, is that Java will have a new release every six months from now on.
These releases will also introduce a new [numbering scheme](https://jaxenter.com/java-9-version-numbering-scheme-137544.html), comparable to what Ubuntu has been using.
While I applaud the idea to deliver faster, it will definitelly come with a learning effort, for developers.

## FN Project

During the first Java keynote, the [FN Project](http://fnproject.io/) was announced and open-sourced. 
The FN project is a container native serverless platform that you can use on any platform supporting Docker.
This also means that local development becomes very easy, which isn't always the case with other serverless solutions.
It has out of the box support Java, Go, Ruby, Python, PHP, and Node.js
I definitelly look forward to playing with it.

## Microservices BOF

In the microservices BOF on Monday evening, [Chris Richardson](https://twitter.com/crichardson) presented what must be the perfect summary of the current state of everything going on in the microservices landscape.
He created a [pattern language](http://microservices.io/patterns/index.html) for microservice architectures at [microservices.io](http://microservices.io/) that I find particulary interesting.
After Chris, [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) proved that he can bring a 45 mins talk in 15 mins with only live coding which was very amusing to watch.
JavaOne surely showed us that microservices are still hot!

# Networking Events

## Silicon Valley

After landing in San Francisco, my colleague [Andreas](https://twitter.com/andreasevers), picked me up at the airport and we went to visit some of the most famous tech companies in Silicon Vallery.
Silicon Valley, in the southern San Francisco Bay Area of California, is home to many start-up and global technology companies. 
Apple, Facebook and Google are among the most prominent.
The size of some of these companies really was remarkable.
Visiting the HP garage, the Android statues etc. was a really great way to cope with Jetlag :)

## Oracle OpenWorld Benelux Bike Tour 2017

Sunday morning, Oracle Benelux organised a Bike Tour for the Benelux attendees, that I liked a lot. 
We biked the typical San Francisco route: Fishermanâ€™s Wharf, Fort Mason, the Marina, Golden Gate Bridge, Sausalito and then back by ferry.
Three years ago, I did a similar tour, but did not take the ferry back.
The ferry was actually very nice: passing Alcatraz and watching the San Francisco skyline pop up.
